## Part 1: New Writing
For this part of the assessment, I developed a script that meets the criteria for **Option 1**:
* **Audience**: Adults learning Software Engineering for professional development.
* **Learning objective**: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to explain what an array is.  
* **Scope of video script**: This video script would briefly introduce Arrays. It would include examples to help the student understand the concept. 

**Submission**: [What is an Array?](https://github.com/mrrogercampbell/what-is-an-array) repo

## Part 2: Visual Asset Creation
I utilized [Lucidchart](http://www.lucidchart.com) to create an annotated diagram that illustrates control flow.
